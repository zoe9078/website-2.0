I am interested in researching the intersection of art and technology. Primarily, I want to research computer-based interactive art, and human-computer interactions. I believe these two subjects are related and inform each other. I am interested in considering what will happen when these subjects are combined. 

My interests in these subjects stem from courses I have taken in the past. For example, I have been heavily influence both by some of my computer science courses, such as a blockchain course I took in 2021, and art courses, like the interdisciplinary art course where I made projects using Arduinos. During this semester I am taking Junior Seminars in both subjects, classes in which you begin to consider what your senior thesis will be on. I have found a lot of inspiration for research while taking these courses. For example, I am just beinging to consider how human-computer interactions and interative art are related, and considering research topics and projects I can explore in order to learn about these subjects. Although I originally mostly had an interest in immersive digital enviorments, I am beginning to explore interavtive enviorments in physical space which are created by computer programs.

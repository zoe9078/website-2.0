### Survey Article from the literature


 - Citation of the article

 Shu Shi and Cheng-Hsin Hsu. 2015. A Survey of Interactive Remote Rendering Systems. ACM Comput. Surv. 47, 4, Article 57 (July 2015), 29 pages. DOI:https://doi.org/10.1145/2719921

 - In two or three sentences, discuss the goals of this article.

The goal of this article is to survey rendering systems (3D graphics) which have been suggested by other researchers and analyze them considering how they might be improved.


 - What is /are the general task(s) that all the methods address in the article?

 The tasks that all of the methods focus on are mitigating network delay which negatively affects interaction, creating latency.


 - What are some of the leading methods introduced and discussed in this paper?

The three main methods introduced are:

* Local rendering
* Prefetch
* Image-based rendering


 - What is the context of the discussion of these methods? For instance, are there demonstrations in light of some task that they address?

 This paper goes over the pros and cons of each method, and states which situation they are best for. These tools are necessary to discuss with the rise of remote rendering systems in order to best improve user experience and mitigate delays. I am sure most of us have encountered that annoying moment when an online game lags, and this research is helping to solve that problem.



 - How can some of these methods be used in your own work? What purpose would the method serve in your work?


 These methods could help my projects because they focus on how to improve the user experience of someone interacting with 3D renders. If I want to research and create 3D renders as interactive art, and the human-computer interactions that follow, I want to eliminate any potential problems the user may face.

### First article from the literature

 - Citation of the article

Cairns, Paul, et al. “Future Design of Accessibility in Games: A Design Vocabulary.” International Journal of Human-Computer Studies, vol. 131, 1 Nov. 2019, pp. 64–71, www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1071581919300801#bbib0001, 10.1016/j.ijhcs.2019.06.010. Accessed 23 Apr. 2020.

 - What is the goal of this article?

 The goal of this article is to argue that accessibility in games is necessary, and suggest a broadening of vocabulary in order to aid developers in making games more accessible to wider ranges of people, specifically people with disabilities.

 - In about 100 words, please summarize the main goal of the article.

First, this article argues for why accessibility is so important in gaming. It notes that 26% of adults identify as being disabled in some way, and even those who may not identify this way can benefit from more accessible designs. It also states that making games more accessible should not decrease the challenge of a game, but open avenues for more people to be able to take on that challenge. Then the article goes over the history of inaccessibility in games, noting how even the smallest design choices can impact someone's ability to play. It also argues that technology that has been made to be accessible in the past has focused too specifically on one disability, and ignored the great diversity in disabled people. The article is arguing for more broadly accessible games as the default. Next it goes over the already set Game Accessibility Guidelines (or GAG). It argues that while these guidelines are generally good for evaluating whether a game is accessible, they are not good at helping developers generate accessible games. Next the article goes over the actual vocabulary they wish to add to game design discussions as well as going over the importance of including disabled people in the design process in order to ensure that games are actually accessible and not patronizing. The goal of this vocabulary is to give developers a normalize and understood way in which to generate and evaluate accessibility in their games.

### Second article from the literature

 - Citation of the article

Reeves, Stuart, and Jordan Beck. “Talking about Interaction*.” International Journal of Human-Computer Studies, vol. 131, Nov. 2019, pp. 144–151, 10.1016/j.ijhcs.2019.05.010. Accessed 6 Aug. 2021.

 - What is the goal of this article?

The goal of this article is to explore disagreement in the area of HCI and consider the language used to discuss HCI, as well as the many types of interactions and their continued usefulness in the field of HCI. Primarily it will be discussing what the concepts of interaction within HCI allow HCI to do.

 - In about 100 words, please summarize the main goal of the article.

 First, this article defines what exactly is meant by 'interactions' when referring to HCI. It means the relations between humans and digital devices and systems. There are so many different types of 'interactions' that can occur, using any of the senses, that it can become confusing. So when they reference 'interaction' in the article it is important to keep in mind that they mean concepts of interaction. Next they explain how researchers are attempting to define 'interaction'. They specifically reference a 2016 article in which the researchers state that the purpose of HCI is to "move from a folk notion of interaction to a notion that really explains interaction". This paper also outlines how there are arguments that having clearly defined models of what 'interaction' is may limit HCI's possible scope. This article does argue that string definitions of 'interaction' can put constraints on HCI. They also point out that some experts in the field seem to argue for dispensing with 'interaction' entirely. Next it talks about different perspectives on HCI, especially now that the field is become more diverse and receiving new insights from different kinds of people. It also discusses how there are calls for interdisciplinarity within the field (I will note that this relates very much to me and my research as it is in inherently interdisciplinary). They also argue for the reframing of "problems" within interaction as a way to make language more cohesive over all of the HCI community. Finally the article argues for reframing HCI so that the focus is not solely on where the community agrees, but so that the community can have discussions about areas of disagreements in a generative way. They call this a "therapeutic" reframing. Overall, they are arguing for thought to be put into all possible consequences of restricting the definition of 'interaction', and how it may impede HCI.

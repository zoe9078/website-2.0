Hello! My name is Zoe White, I am currently a junior computer science and art double major. I come from Saranac Lake, a small town in the Adirondack Mountains, and I am currently attending Allegheny College. My interests primarily include art and technology and I am excited to research these subjects more in the next few years! I find interactive art and human-computer interactions very interesting and that is where my research will be primarily focused for the next few years. </p>

In terms of hardware I will need a computer capable of using the software necessary for the project. I will also need some way to measure interaction, whether it be through gaze detection, a controller, a button, or something else. Also, I will need some way to distribute the project.

Tools which I will be using consist of art tools such as blender and others. Also, if I am going to use gaze detection software or heat mapping I will need to use a software similar to tensor flow

I will need skills which allow me to create the actual art. I still believe I want this art to be interactive in some sense, although exactly how is still up for debate. I just believe that considering I partially want to explore human-computer interactions. I believe that using interactive art will activate the interactions between human and computer, allowing for more direct study of them.

I do think generating data would enhance this project. However, generating data from people requires proper practice and security. This is certainly something I will want to educate myself on further before pursuing this. I would, if I do generate data, delete the data immediately to ensure protection.

I think this project will probably take the full time allotted with everything including the art, creation of software, writings, etc. However, as I start to clarify exactly what this project is I will be able to whittle it down and eliminate unnecessary aspects. I think I still need to brainstorm more, as I don't feel totally satisfied yet.

Successful results would look like a tool which allows for data collection and analysis concerning viewer perception of art, as well as an interactive art project with which this tool is used.

I will analyze results by seeing if the data collected has any commonalities (for example: "red is the color which draws attention first" or "people will look at complex images for longer then minimalistic images"). Then I will consider the impacts this has on the viewers perception of art. For example, let's say I create an image and I think that the image's subject is person 1. Now let's say that when I get the data back I see that people spent the most time looking at person 2. This would challenge the way I view my art piece and give me an interesting perspective about how other people might analyze my piece.

One project I think would be really interesting to create would be a visual project which adapts to your gaze. For example, either changing the area of the piece which you are, or aren't, looking at. I think this would be an interesting and unique experience for the viewer and could explore ways in which artists can play with viewer's perceptions. One thing I think would be an extremely interesting application of this is a video game which actually interacts with your gaze. Imagine a horror game where you couldn't  look at the monster with your own eyes or it would get aggravated! Or one in which depth of field and clarity was intensified based upon where you were gazing! Of course, these applications are far to advanced for a comp project, but the idea of this level of interaction and immersion is an exciting one!

Assumptions my project makes are that gaze actually will have anything to do with people's conceptual perception of a piece. However, I do feel like this is a pretty sound assumption as where you look directly influences what you see (surprise!), and what you see will impact how you analyze a visual piece.
